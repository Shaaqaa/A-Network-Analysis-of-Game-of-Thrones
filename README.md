# A-Network-Analysis-of-Game-of-Thrones
Here is my first experience on Network Analysis by python . Inspired by a project on datacamp.com

# Motivation 

As a junior neuroimage and neuroscience researcher , It is essential to have some practical experience on network analysis. As a first experience I got inspired by 
[A Network Analysis of Game of Thrones](https://projects.datacamp.com/projects/76). I addition to what has been done in datacamp project I have also play a little bit around . 


## Introduction 

In the available dataset two characters are considered to co-occur if their names appear in the vicinity of 15 words from one another in the books. 

## Technical aspects

you can find the analysis in python on the jupyther notebook. Here you can find list of the libraries that I used.

- [panda](https://pandas.pydata.org/) a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.
- [networkx](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/tutorial.html)
